Earlier this week, we had an AMA with our leadership team. For those who do not know what AMA is, it stands for _Ask Me Anything_.
This is usually a large company meeting where employees can ask any question to their leadership team.
It is a great way to learn further about what the leadership team is considering or what their thoughts are on the future of the company.
But this is also a good time to relay the struggles employees are having in their day to day work,
 and more importantly to ask them what actions are they taking to improve the situation on that front.

However, asking a question that would get a meaningful answer is quite difficult.
There are many pitfalls one can fall into. The general framework I use when preparing the question I would like to ask follows a simple list of 4 rules:
1. Ask open and neutral questions
2. Be constructive
3. Be precise, but concise
4. Consider their point of view

## Ask open and neutral questions

Sometimes a situation at work is highly emotional, either because it affects us or our colleagues directly, or because it goes against some of your core values/beliefs. In these cases, it can be tempting to frame a closed question, where your leadership team will be restricted in their possible answer.

But let's take an example to make this more concrete. One of the most emotional moments I had to experience (unfortunately multiple times over my career) was related to layoff announcements. One way to ask your leadership team could look like this:
> Have you considered lowering your salaries rather than laying-off people?

As you can see, the tone is very negative, and we can tell the person asking is angry with the leadership team. While this is totally comprehensible, I do not think this question would lead to any meaningful answer. If the point of asking your question is to release the frustration and anger you feel, I would reconsider doing this in an AMA. This is not the place nor the time to do so. Instead, I would recommend talking with your colleagues, or any relative you have full trust in.

However, behind that closed question, there is still something valuable to ask your leadership team. One way I would rephrase that in an open-ended way would be like:
> What other options have you considered before deciding to do layoffs?

In that case, it leaves space for the leadership team to expose the alternatives they might have explored. Of course, it is possible that the leadership team hasn't bothered considering any other alternative. But at least, in that case, their lack of leadership would be very evident.

Even though asking these questions does not change the fact that layoffs happened, and you might have lost some close colleagues, at least you can learn about your leadership team's thinking process. What options did they consider, what improvements would they make to avoid that situation in the future or any other actionable way to improve how they run the company.

## Be constructive

When asking questions about some frustration you experience, it can be tempting to only highlight the struggles you face, and wait for the leadership team to propose solutions. But more often than not, the leadership team might not have all the solutions in mind. This is not a single-way communication. You do have the power to initiate a positive change. In the end, you're likely the one with the more context on the situation, so you might be best equipped to offer some concrete steps that would make your lives better. And even if you do not have any concrete idea, simply offering your help and asking your leadership team what you can do to improve the situation, will open the floor to a better conversation.

## Be precise, but concise

If your question is vague, the leadership team can take any angle that favors them and address your question in a way that would not do justice to your point. And I'm not saying this as the leadership having bad intentions, it's simply human to do so. By being precise, it will help the leadership team to adequately answer your question.

But you also need to be concise. Asking a question that spreads over multiple sentences, and even paragraphs will muddy the water. Maybe you're trying to ask too many things at once, and in this case the leadership team will probably pick only one aspect and answer that one only. By keeping your question concise, you will ensure the leadership team answers your specific point.

## Consider their point of view

That one is probably the most important one in my mind. Before asking a question, try to consider where they are coming from. What was the context, and the trade-offs they had to weigh? Are you able to articulate a reasoning that would explain the situation you are facing? In a sense, you should try to answer your own question in a conciliatory way, and see if you can see many ways it could be answered.

A long time ago, I read a book that had a transformative effect on how I see the world.
