summary: Los Angeles in having massive fires. This post is about our society and how we can see fire everywhere (from actual wildfires to cybertrucks). A gloomy journal entry on what it's like to experience wildfires. A reminiscence of how little we are against natural disasters. Still contains some pieces of hope (people helping others - Humanity can still show up solidarity after all), but these are tenuous. I'm adding this here, so I can remember what January 2025 was like when I look back.
