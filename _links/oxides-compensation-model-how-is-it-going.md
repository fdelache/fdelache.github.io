summary: An updtae on Oxide's compensation model. Where they basically pay every employee the same salary. It's interesting to see what are the second order effects of such a policy on people's behaviour. People are usually interested in doing a good job, and having such a clear and simple compensation model frees up a lot of the bureaucracy around compensation and performance review, while allowing much more fluidity in how the company is being run. Makes me think of what would happen to a society if there was a generous universal income. People are usually scared that it would lead to people doing nothing, but I'm pretty sure people still want to be part of society and contribute to it fully. Anyway, interesting to see companies trying something radically different than what's usually done, and more importantly to see what are the effects of such transparent choices.
