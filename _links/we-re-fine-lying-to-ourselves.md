summary: Shared from Brian Merchant's post. A bit darker this time, and another description of how we try to continue living our lives as if nothing had changed. Reminds me of when Covid hit, we initially thought it would be a short spike of trouble. But lessons learned, it lasts more than that. We are likely to experience profound changes in how we will live in our societies, and we cannot comprehend that. As if our brain couldn't grasp what's coming our way. We try to stick to what feels usual, even if that means taking two work meetings in a car using mobile thetering while escaping from a wildfire.
