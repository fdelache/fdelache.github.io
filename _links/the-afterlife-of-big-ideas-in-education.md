summary: An overview of an experiment implemented in Nathan Hale High School (in the US), which led to great improvement in pretty much all aspects. Due to its success, the experiment has been scaled up and implemented in a large part of the US but with mitigated success, and mostly failed afterward. The underlying lesson is that the implementation process is more important than the end goal. And involving teachers from the start and let them build their own solution is what leads to great success. I think we can make the same kind of conclusion in software Engineering as well. The best teams I worked with were the ones that developed their own way of working by brainstorming together, and not becase someone tolds them how they should work.
