summary: Fascinating (very) long essay on considering AI as a normal technology. From that lens, AI doomerism and AI hype are both considered inaccurate depiction of a possible future for AI. While not minimizing the impacts AI will have on our world, it offers some keys to interpret the possible evolution of AI, and what regulation can and cannot do. What's more interesting is seeing how regulation can accelerate AI diffusion, which could then help counter the dangers of AI. For someone not versed into regulation theory, this was deeply interesting to understand how technology evolves, is adopted and diffused into our societal world. Would be interesting to read it again in several years from now, to see how it was able to predict some of the potential effects of AI.
