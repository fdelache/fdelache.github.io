                The complete content of this page is written by me. The images used are either photographs I took myself, or art made be me. No Generative AI was used for these parts.

                I do use AI assistants to help me write the software underlying this blog site, as well as proofread my writing (as a non English native speaker).
                But AI is only a tool used to understand and write code, not for expressing my own thoughts. A little bit of authenticity is aways welcome, and this is what I'm striving for.

                Why this page you might ask? I stumbled on this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cassidoo.co/post/3l7aqai5vsg2w">Cassidy's bluesky post</a>,
                which emphasize the <a href="https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto">/ai manifesto</a>.
                Found that it was a good idea :-)
